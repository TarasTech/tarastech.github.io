# PC-Builder-Services
Project was created for skill based assessment that was held at per-scholas. This was created mostly from scratch HTML and using Bootstrap.

Website simulates a company which decided to make a wiki page to allow their customers easy research on building pc's.

The website has a few jokes, but it was mostly satire.

On the site you can learn about all the different things you need to know to build a pc, from basic information, to parts and part average prices.
